# Coursera-Front-End-Final-Project
A fun little JS guess the difference game

This game was created as the week 3 assignment for the Coursera Front End class. I added added a feature allowing the game to be played again if the user desired. The assignment wanted the file broken up into four submissions, the only one that matters is the final one, part4.html.

It's just a little HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. Feel free to load into your browser and kill a few minutes.
